A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence that can process and generate natural language, such as speech or text. A large language model usually has a very big vocabulary, or the set of words it can recognize, and a complex grammar system, or the rules that govern how words can be combined and modified. A large language model can perform various tasks with natural language, such as translation, summarization, question answering, sentiment analysis, and text generation. Some examples of large language models are GPT-3, BERT, and XLNet.
